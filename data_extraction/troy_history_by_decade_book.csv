1500s,"The early 1500s witnessed the initial European exploration of regions that would eventually impact the future site of Troy, New York. In 1504, French seamen sailed west of Newfoundland, becoming some of the first Europeans to view the wide expanse of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This pioneering French reconnaissance marked an early step in charting the North American coastline, laying groundwork for future European encounters with the continent."
1520s,"The 1520s witnessed the start of French-sponsored voyages of discovery to North America, laying early groundwork for European engagement with the continent, including the region that would become New York. In 1523, King Francis I commissioned Giovanni da Verrazzano to explore the Atlantic north of Cuba, seeking a western route to the Indian Archipelago. Verrazzano departed in January 1524 and, by early March, reached the North American coast near Cape Fear. This ambitious journey marked a significant early step in the European charting of the eastern seaboard, paving the way for future exploration and settlement."
1560s,"The 1560s were a pivotal decade for European cartography and the conceptualization of North America's geography. In 1569, Flemish cartographer Gerard Mercator published a significant world map depicting ""the Great River"" (likely the Hudson) with a French designation within the region then known as ""New France."" This period also saw active proposals for extensive exploration, including a plan to navigate the American coast at the fortieth degree of latitude—encompassing the future site of Troy—to find a northern passage to a western sea. These ambitions, partly fueled by contemporary maps and letters from explorers like Captain Smith, underscored a determined effort to discover new westward trade routes."
1600s,"The 1600s in the region that would become Troy, New York, began with pivotal European exploration. In 1609, Henry Hudson, employed by the Dutch East India Company, attempted to find a northern passage to Asia aboard the Half Moon. When impenetrable ice fields in the Arctic Sea blocked his intended route, he was forced to change course. This initial exploratory voyage marked the dawn of European awareness and interaction with the wider Hudson River Valley, laying the groundwork for future settlement and trade in the area."
1610s,"In 1614, Dutch traders, having reaped significant profits, petitioned the Lords States General of the Netherlands for exclusive trading rights with the natives along the river. This request was granted on October 11, 1614, providing a special license for four voyages to the region within a three-year period, starting in 1615. Upon the expiration of this exclusive privilege in 1618, the Dutch government permitted multiple vessels to sail to New Netherland to procure furs. This decade thus saw the formalization and subsequent loosening of early Dutch commercial interests and trade in the area."
1620s,"The 1620s saw the official beginning of Dutch colonization in New Netherland, with the West India Company formed in 1621 to oversee trade and settlement. In 1624, Walloon families arrived, establishing Fort Orange on the Upper Hudson (near present-day Albany) and interacting with local Indigenous groups like the Mohawks and the Mohegans, whose village was located near the future site of Troy. By 1626, mounting isolation and escalating warfare between the Mohawk and Mohegan tribes led to a disastrous Dutch intervention, resulting in the temporary abandonment of Fort Orange by 1627. Following the Mohawks' decisive victory over the Mohegans by 1628, the West India Company revised its colonization strategy in 1629, introducing the Patroon system which facilitated Kiliaen Van Rensselaer's acquisition of large land tracts in the Upper Hudson, including the area near Troy."
1630s,"The 1630s marked the active establishment of New Netherland by the Dutch West India Company, which attracted colonists with land grants after deterring a French claim at the Groote Rivier's mouth. Settlers founded Fort Orange near present-day Albany, exploring the fertile Hudson Valley and interacting with local Mohawk and Mohegan tribes, the latter dwelling near the future site of Troy. Initial peaceful relations deteriorated when the Mohawk and Mohegan nations went to war, drawing the Dutch into a disastrous conflict near West Troy that led to casualties and a temporary evacuation of Fort Orange's remaining colonists. Despite these challenges, the decade also saw the implementation of the patroon system, with Kiliaen Van Rensselaer acquiring vast tracts of land, including the area of modern Troy, to further the region's colonization."
1640s,"The 1640s in the area around modern-day Troy, New York, marked a period of both settlement expansion and increasing conflict for the Dutch. While early colonists at Fort Orange praised the region's natural fertility and resources, previously amicable relations with local Native American tribes quickly deteriorated. A disastrous Dutch military engagement, supporting the Mohegans against the Mohawks near West Troy, resulted in Dutch casualties and the temporary evacuation of Fort Orange's remaining settlers to Fort Amsterdam. Concurrently, Kiliaen Van Rensselaer continued to acquire land, settling more colonists and Protestant refugees. The decade also featured a memorable natural event: a severe winter in 1646-47, followed by a great freshet, culminated in 1647 with the extraordinary stranding of a whale in the Hudson River near Cohoes, an event that led to the naming of Walvis Eylandt."
1650s,"The 1650s saw the Dutch intensify their colonization efforts in New Netherland, particularly along the Groote Rivier (Hudson). The Dutch West India Company encouraged settlement, leading to the establishment of Fort Orange near present-day Albany after a confrontation with French claims to the territory. Initial settlers began farming and praising the region's abundant resources, but peaceful relations with local Mohawk and Mohegan tribes soon deteriorated into warfare. This conflict led to a significant Dutch military defeat and the temporary evacuation of some colonists from Fort Orange. Despite these setbacks, the decade was marked by important land acquisitions, including Jan Barentsen Wemp's 1659 purchase of the Great Meadow Ground, laying foundational claims in the area that would later become Troy."
1660s,"The 1660s marked a period of significant land transactions and evolving colonial authority in the region. In 1661, settlers acquired the Groote Vlachte, the future site of Schenectady, signaling continued expansion. A notable landholder, Jan Barentsen Wemp, died in 1663, leading to the transfer of his extensive properties to his widow and eventually to Sweer Teunise Van Velsen. A pivotal shift occurred in 1667 when English Governor Richard Nicolls confirmed Van Velsen's land patent, thereby solidifying English colonial rule over the former Dutch territories. By 1669, Van Velsen further consolidated his holdings and moved to Schenectady, reflecting ongoing settlement and changes in land ownership dynamics within the expansive Rensselaerswyck manor."
1670s,"During the 1670s, the future site of Troy, New York, saw continued European settlement and economic activity, primarily through land acquisitions and the operation of saw-mills. Numerous transactions occurred, such as the sale of a saw-mill in 1674, the Poesten Mill in 1675, and a farm between the Poesten and Wynants Kills in 1676. By the end of the decade, land ownership was increasingly formalized through patents granted by the English governor, underscoring the region's shift from Dutch to English colonial administration. For instance, Robert Saunders received an English patent for the Passquassick woodland in 1679, indicating the ongoing expansion and consolidation of European farms in the area."
1680s,"The 1680s began with notable concern among settlers, who expressed anxieties following the appearance of Newton's comet in December 1680. A significant development in the region was Albany's official designation as a city in 1686, reflecting its growing importance as a hub. That same year, an expedition from Albany engaged with local Native American tribes. By the end of the decade, the ongoing formalization of land ownership was evident through property transactions, such as the 1689 deed for Poesten Bouwery near present-day Troy."
1690s,"The 1690s brought a period of intense danger and conflict to the Upper Hudson River Valley. On February 8th, 1690, a devastating attack by French soldiers and their Native American allies struck Schenectady, resulting in the massacre of most unguarded inhabitants and the capture of others taken to Canada. This brutal event instilled widespread terror among settlers throughout the region. It underscored the severe vulnerability of colonial settlements to ongoing hostilities between European powers and their indigenous allies."
1700s,"In the early 1700s, the future site of Troy began to take shape through key land transactions and the establishment of local governance. In 1707, Dirk Van der Heyden made a pivotal purchase of a large farm, extending from the Poesten Kill to the Piscawen Kill, which formed the core of the area that would become Troy. This land title was officially confirmed in 1720 by the Van Rensselaer family, settling any previous claims. Subsequently, Van der Heyden and several others were designated as the first trustees for the freeholders and inhabitants of this growing community. These developments mark the initial steps in organizing the land and its residents into a recognized settlement."
1710s,"In the 1710s, the land destined to become Troy, New York, experienced significant changes in ownership and division. On April 24, 1711, the Schuyler heirs sold a 400-acre bouwery, located on the east side of the Hudson opposite Fort Orange, to Stephanis Groesbeck of Albany. Later, on December 29, 1715, this farm was formally divided between new proprietors. Myndert Schuyler acquired the southern portion, known as the ""Laager Kind"" (Lower End). The northern part, called the ""Opper Eind"" (Upper End), went to Peter Van Brugh, marking key developments in the area's early European land tenure."
1720s,"In 1720, significant land developments laid the groundwork for the future site of Troy, New York. On December 15th, Dirk Vander Heyden's title to substantial tracts on the east side of the Hudson River, opposite Fort Orange, was officially confirmed. These holdings, known as Gesmessert, extended approximately three Dutch miles and included land between the Poesten Kill and the Piscawen Kill. Vander Heyden actively settled colonists from Holland and Protestant French refugees on these newly confirmed properties, initiating further development in the region during the 1720s."
1730s,"The 1730s in the region surrounding what would become Troy, New York, were marked by ongoing land development and transfer. New settlements emerged, exemplified by the founding of Poughkeepsie in 1735, signaling regional growth alongside established centers like Albany. Significant land transactions characterized the decade, including Myndert Schuyler selling property in 1730 and deeding other holdings to his sons by 1731. These family properties continued to evolve, culminating in Jacob and Mattys formally dividing a farm into distinct sections by 1739."
1740s,"The provided historical account offers limited details on major developments in the Troy area during the 1740s. However, it indicates continued European settlement and the establishment of private land ownership. Personal milestones recorded include a birth in 1743 and a death in 1746. Notably, a land transaction occurred in 1748, with Edward Collins conveying part of a farm near the Wynants Kill to Jan Van Buren, illustrating the ongoing transfer and division of property in the region."
1750s,"The 1750s in the Troy area were marked by continued European family settlement and domestic development. In 1752, Hattys Van der Heyden constructed a brick dwelling, followed by another Van der Heyden house being built in 1756. This decade also saw the birth of future local figures, including William Fraser in 1753 and Matthias Van der Heyden in 1758. These events highlight a period of modest growth and generational continuity for the established families in the region."
1760s,"In the 1760s, Dutch interests actively sought to establish and secure settlements in the Hudson Valley, repelling French claims and founding Fort Orange (Albany). Colonists, arriving on ships like the Nieu Nederlandt, described the region as fertile and rich in resources, and they began cultivating land near existing Mohawk and Mohegan villages, including one on the future site of Troy. However, rising tensions quickly led to warfare between these Native American tribes. The Dutch became embroiled in this conflict, suffering a significant defeat near West Troy that led to a temporary withdrawal of settlers from Fort Orange. Despite these challenges, further land acquisition and settlement by Dutch and French Protestant families continued on the east side of the Hudson, encompassing the Troy area."
1770s,"The 1770s in the Upper Hudson region were largely defined by the burgeoning American Revolution and continued local development. In 1775, settlers courageously joined the protests against British taxation, with Colonel Philip Schuyler taking command of the Army of the Northern Department. His forces, which included local officers, marched in the summer of 1777 to stop General Burgoyne's advance on Albany, even as some local figures faced defeat and imprisonment in other significant battles. Concurrently, the new settlement of Lansingburgh was laid out and named in 1771, signifying ongoing efforts at urban expansion alongside various land transactions among prominent local families."
1780s,"In 1786, the future site of Troy was a rural area comprised of at least five farms, intersected by roads near the Hudson River. Nearby towns like Hudson were incorporated in 1785, indicating established development in the region. By 1789, a small body of settlers officially named the place ""Troy"" and publicly declared their ambition for it to become a renowned center for trade and navigation. This bold expectation for the nascent settlement, despite its humble beginnings, marked the optimistic outlook of its founders in the closing years of the decade."
1790s,"In the 1790s, Troy, New York, rapidly emerged as a burgeoning commercial center, with settlers confidently expecting it to become famous for trade and navigation. Distinguished by a collective ""concert of action,"" the town's founders, primarily Yankees, united to prioritize economic prosperity and growth over political concerns. This concentrated effort led to visible developments, including the construction of commercial buildings around 1790 and the village's first brick dwelling in 1792. Troy quickly became a flourishing hub for purchasing and shipping grain and country produce, actively rivaling and dividing commerce with the established city of Albany."
1800s,"The 1800s were a pivotal decade for Troy, New York, marked by rapid growth and significant civic and economic developments. Early in the decade, key civic infrastructure projects were underway, with land conveyed for the town's meeting-house in 1800 and further improvements like fencing the public square by 1803. By 1807, Troy had established extensive trade routes northward through New York and Vermont into Canada, demonstrating its burgeoning commercial power. This swift expansion, bolstered by its advantageous location at the head of navigation, fueled intense rivalry with established cities like Albany. Troy's success was largely attributed to the united efforts and concerted action of its enterprising founders, who prioritized the village's collective interests."
1810s,"In the 1810s, Troy, New York, was characterized by its rapid growth and the ""superior energy"" of its settlers, who exhibited ""concert of action"" in pursuing common interests. The village continued its ascent as a significant center for trade and navigation, quickly surpassing Lansingburgh and establishing itself as a formidable commercial rival to Albany. This period also marked the development of more formal governance, with a president elected to the board of village trustees in 1813-14. Concurrently, the community began to solidify its social and spiritual foundations, initiating religious services and considering the formation of organized societies."
1820s,"In the 1820s, Troy, New York, experienced a period of continued development, notably with the construction of the State Dam in 1823, an infrastructure project that led to the submergence of a local island. This decade saw Troy further solidify its position as a growing commercial hub on the Hudson River. Driven by the ""superior energy"" and ""concert of action"" of its residents, Troy significantly advanced its trade and navigation interests. This concerted effort allowed Troy to increasingly challenge Albany's established dominance and divide commerce with its larger neighbor, underscoring its rapid progress."
1830s,"During the 1830s, Troy experienced a period of remarkable growth and prosperity, gaining significant recognition for its industry and enterprise. By 1835, it was lauded by a metropolitan journalist as a ""pattern"" for other places, rapidly advancing and outstripping older settlements. An English novelist observed in 1837 that Troy, boasting a population of 20,000, successfully competed with Albany, effectively ""ravishing"" much of the eastern trade. This rapid development was largely attributed to the ""superior energy"" and ""concert of action"" among its citizens, who collectively furthered the city's mercantile and manufacturing interests."
1840s,"During the 1840s, Troy continued to develop as a significant urban center, building upon its established commercial rivalry with Albany and a population that had reached 20,000. The decade saw notable institutional growth, including an existing institute moving its sessions to the Bank Building in 1841. Educational infrastructure expanded with the founding of the Warren Free Institute in 1844, which subsequently occupied a new building. Additionally, 1845 brought financial and organizational changes as stockholders' shares were transferred to an association, which then purchased further shares. These events highlight a period of ongoing civic, educational, and economic consolidation within a rapidly expanding Troy."
1850s,"During the 1850s, Troy, New York, experienced continued urban and commercial developments. In 1854, Samuel, an 88-year-old resident, passed away in the city. Significant changes to the cityscape included the removal of an older dwelling from 1819 in 1855. Furthermore, the commercial sector saw activity, with J. Quackenbush & Co., a dry goods and carpets merchant, vacating their former store and relocating their stock in 1856."
1860s,"The 1860s in Troy, New York, were marked by several specific local occurrences. In 1862, the mansion housing the Warren Free Institute was destroyed by fire on May 10th. A banking-house, which had operated since 1830, discontinued its business operations on February 27th, 1865. The decade also saw B.H. Hall's work published in ""Our Young Folks"" in September 1866, followed by another significant fire on June 25th, 1867, that destroyed a large wooden building on the corner of River and Congress streets."
1870s,"The 1870s in Troy, New York, saw several significant changes to its urban landscape and property ownership. In 1871, the Troy Times Building was erected, displacing an earlier brick structure. The decade also included property transactions, such as the 1874 sale of two lots and their buildings to the First Unitarian Church, and the demolition of an old wooden building in 1872. The period concluded with a notable fire in December 1879, which destroyed a two-story brick dwelling at River and Hutton streets."
1880s,"The 1880s in Troy were a period of continued urban development and civic changes. In 1882, an existing dwelling was demolished to make way for the construction of the Keenan Building. Later in the decade, in 1888, the Common Council renamed North Second Street to Fifth Avenue, prompting the local society to change its name to the Fifth Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church of Troy. Further transformations occurred in November 1889, when a prominent 18th-century wooden building on River Street was demolished. These events reflect ongoing modernization and significant alterations to the city's landscape and community identity."
